In this week, I watched hours of soderting turorial 101 videos on Youtube and others' great Arduino work.

They were so amazing that I was a little bit of frusrating about my inspiration. I think I would never achieve their heights. But I still decided to do my best.

I also used tinkerCad to stimulate my circuit for.(It's a little bit of slow I don't know why.)
